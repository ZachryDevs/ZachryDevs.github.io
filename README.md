# Welcome to my website building journey using github as my host
## I fully plan on integrating this website onto my raspberry pi later this year.
For now, I am using this github as a way to develop Java Plugins, feel free to check on my progress.
I will be uploading my fails and successes alike, there are lessons to be learned on both fronts. 
For the most part, I will be focused on furthering my web development capabilities by creating a website for my entrepreneurially gifted significant other.
